# Pi Pico composite video

This repository contains my implementation of a composite video peripheral for the Pi Pico, using the Pico's PIO subsystem. Functions are available for drawing rectangles, XBM images and text to the screen.

Below is a link to a short video demonstrating the Pico's composite video output in action:
